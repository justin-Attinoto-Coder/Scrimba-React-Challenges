If you wondering how to check if the input is in or out of focus, just Google the relevant terms; this is a common question, and you will get back lots of results. However, keep an eye on whether the results you are reading are geared toward older versions of React, and focus on the ones that are geared toward the current version. There's an easier way to do this now than there used to be. 

If you want something to be rendered different ways depending on different circumstances, what do you generally need to do in React to make that happen? 

Think about it, and then if you're still stuck, scroll down to line 50 for another hint. 














































You need to set up a state and then use that state's value to do some conditional logic. The state should change depending on whether the input is in or out of focus. See hint 1 for more on this. 

Follow the chain of events that happen when the user clicks the "AutoComplete" button. What happens at the end of the chain? How can you use that to accomplish the task of clearing the input element? 

If you're still stuck after doing that, scroll down to line 50 for another hint. 














































If you want to control an input element's value in React, what do you generally need to do? 

Still stuck? Scroll down to line 100.















































Read the previous hint again: If you want to *control* an input element's value in React, what do you generally need to do? 

Note the emphasis on "control"... I can't say much more about this without totally giving away the answer!  


The text for the to-do list items (the paragraphs with the class name of "to-do-list-item-text") is getting crossed out when the user clicks the "AutoComplete" button, so something must be working right for that aspect of the code — and whatever it is, the checkboxes must be missing it. 

What is it? What does the text have that the checkboxes lack? How can you do something similar for the checkboxes that is already being done for the text?
