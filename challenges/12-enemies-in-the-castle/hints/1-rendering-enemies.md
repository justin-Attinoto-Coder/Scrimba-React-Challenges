Consider starting off by just rendering a single Enemy element onto the page, instead of worrying about all three of them. This will simplify the task and give you a better idea of what you need to do to "scale up" your code to encompass all three enemies.  

You could do this manually by just writing out three Enemey elements and passing in different props to them corresponding to different objects in the enemiesData array. 

However, there is also an array method that will allow you to take each of the objects and generate an Enemy element for it automatically.
