# Challenge 05: RPG Hero Name Input

**Instructor:** Daniel Beckrose  
**Platform:** Scrimba

## Solution Notes

This challenge demonstrates controlled inputs in React forms. The key concepts include:

- Using `useState` to manage input value
- Creating a `handleChange` function to update state
- Setting input attributes like `maxLength`, `placeholder`, `required`, and `disabled`
- Preventing default form submission with `preventDefault()`
- Transforming user input on form submission

The solution uses a separate `handleChange` function for clarity, though an inline arrow function would work equivalently.
